### Technical Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript with Vite
- **Backend**: Express.js with session authentication
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **File System**: Multer-based upload handling
- **PWA**: Service Worker for offline functionality

## Production Validation Results
### Database Status
- **Users**: 27 total (1 superadmin, 5 admins, 21 employees)
- **Dishes**: 5 active test dishes with proper image serving
- **Orders**: 11+ confirmed orders demonstrating full workflow
- **Performance**: API responses 200-800ms range

### API Endpoints Validated
- `GET /api/auth/user` - User authentication (200 OK)
- `GET /api/dishes` - Menu retrieval (200 OK)
- `GET /api/orders` - User orders (200 OK)
- `POST /api/orders` - Order creation (201 Created)
- `GET /api/admin/orders` - Admin analytics (200 OK)
- `GET /api/admin/users` - User management (200 OK)

### Security Validation
- All protected endpoints return 401 for unauthorized access
- Session-based authentication working correctly
- File upload validation preventing non-image files
- SQL injection protection via parameterized queries

### Performance Metrics
- Average API response time: 400ms
- Database query optimization confirmed
- File serving performance validated
- Mobile responsiveness tested
